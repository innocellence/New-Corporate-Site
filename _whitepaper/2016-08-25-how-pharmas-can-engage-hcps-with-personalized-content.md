On one hand, plenty of medical content is being created every day — but on the other hand, HCPs still have difficulty finding the *right* content to suit their needs. 

A major reason why this dilemma continues to plague HCPs is because they are not being provided with content that is customized to their preferences — HCPs must search through an ocean of content just to find information that's trustworthy and relevant to their specialty.

### How Can Pharmas Provide HCPs with Personalized Content? 

To deliver personalized content to HCPs, pharmas must follow several key principles: 
 
- Understand HCP preferences including the tone/voice of content they respond to, what time of day they are most likely to read content, what content formats are viewed, and what social media/professional channels they visit regularly
- Deliver content according to the therapeutic area of HCPs and ensure that it adds value to their specific area of practice
- Deliver content that relates to HCPs specific patient populations and ensure it can help them engage their patients better


### How Can Pharmas Put These Principles Into Action? 

This is where digital solutions such as [digital analytics](http://blog.innocellence.com/2016/07/11/why-digital-analytics-is-crucial-for-optimizing-pharma-business-outcomes/) and social listening can really help. The first step is to use analytics data on your web- and mobile-based systems to segment your HCP list. 

Segmentation should be conducted from different angles. While segmenting by therapeutic area is a logical choice, you can also segment HCPs into different subsets that are relevant to your business such as "early adopters, "competitor loyalists," and/or current prescribers and non-prescribers. 

With this audience data in hand, it's possible to discover key audience preferences that enable  pharmas to customize medical content to different HCP target audiences.

The second step is to evaluate the response to your content. A key benefit of digital content over print is that user engagement behavior can be measured, including: 

- How long do readers spend reading each content piece? 
- What topics generate the most readership? 
- What types of content do audiences read and share more (e.g. infographics, video, 1,000-word articles, etc.)
- Which publishing channels (e.g. company blog, Facebook, etc.) are more effective for sharing certain types of content?
- How many readers are "return users" of your content platforms? 

And the more data you are able to accumulate over time, the more effective your content will be when it comes to satisfying HCPs’ preferences.


### What If There Is Not Enough Accurate and Quantitative Data Available? 

For pharmas that don't have much data on HCP audiences because they are creating/refining their [content strategies](http://blog.innocellence.com/2016/07/12/content-strategy-what-is-it-and-why-does-every-pharma-need-one/) or are in the process of creating new mobile apps, websites, or social media channels for sharing content — there is one key asset that shouldn't be ignored — the salesforce. 

Don’t forget that sales reps (SRs) usually spend the most face-to-face time with HCPs. And chances are good that they probably already have answers to some of the content personalization questions you're looking for. 

Once you do that, you can use your digital solutions to fill in the communications and data collection gaps. Meanwhile, your SRs can continue to play a vital role in promoting the digital platforms where personalized content is being shared. 

So striking a balance between digital technology and human touch of SRs can be a powerful combination for successfully engaging HCPs with personalized content.
