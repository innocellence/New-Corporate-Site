title: 'Pharma Content Marketing: What Really Separates Good from Bad Content?'
---

According to a [recent study](#http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/mediaeloqua/documents/Content+Marketing+Kapost+Eloqua+ebook.pdf) by Kapost and Oracle Eloqua, companies that publish valuable content regularly through digital channels such as blogs and social media are more likely to increase web traffic, brand awareness, and decrease acquisition costs compared to companies that rely on interruptive advertising approaches. 

In the pharmaceutical industry, reports show that key audiences such as [healthcare professionals (HCPs)](#http://blogs.deloitte.com/centerforhealthsolutions/pharma-adoption-of-social-media-a-prescription-for-physician-engagement/) and [patients](#http://lps.wegohealth.com/patientengagementreport/)  not only want, but expect more engaging digital content from pharmas that helps them make better health decisions. 

But as more pharmas begin to develop and execute [content strategies](#http://blog.innocellence.com/2016/07/12/content-strategy-what-is-it-and-why-does-every-pharma-need-one/), the key to achieving content marketing success will lie not in producing the more content than the competition — but in creating more high-quality content than competitors. 

####What Distinguishes Good from Bad Content?  
Effective content marketing provides target audiences with the information they need to make better decisions — from choosing the right product or service to making better health, medical, and lifestyle choices.

And while the purpose of content marketing is to drive profitable customer actions, pharmas should never forget that consumers want content that serves their needs — not the needs of the company. 

So what really distinguishes good from bad content? 

Here’s a little infographic we’ve prepared to answer that very question: 


####A Final Note on Content Quality 
The question of whether quantity is better than quality is something many companies struggle to answer. 

A company that focuses too much on quantity may generate more web traffic, leads, and brand awareness — but its brand perception may suffer if it consistently publishes shallow and uninformative content. 

On the other hand, a company that focuses too much on quality may benefit from better engagement and lead quality by publishing detailed, and informative content — but there may not be a consistent increase in web traffic and leads. 

Ideally, companies should aim to strike a balance between quality and quantity by creating a mix of short- and long-form content that satisfies the “good” content criteria. 

Using [digital analytics](http://blog.innocellence.com/2016/07/11/why-digital-analytics-is-crucial-for-optimizing-pharma-business-outcomes/) to monitor content performance can help brands optimize content quality by showing what content tactics (e.g. headlines, topics, copy length) work best with target audiences.
